    <h1>What is Coding?</h1>
    <p><b>Coding</b> is the primary method for allowing intercommunication between humans and machines. 
       In the nascent stages of coding, this was done using punch cards and physically placing them on the
       computer. Then, came computer programming languages that helped humans communicate with computers
       using a set of instructions. Essentially, this set of instructions that tells the computer what 
       it has to do is a code.</p>
    
    <h1>How does Coding Work?</h1>
    <p>
        In order to understand what coding is and how it works, we must firstly set the premise. In this case, the premise
        is that computers do not understand words or human languages. That may be a little difficult for us to process today
        as we all speak in voice commands to our Google Home devices, isnt it? That is the beauty of code. Today, all our 
        devices are coded to understand human languages through voice commands.
